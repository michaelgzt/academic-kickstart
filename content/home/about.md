My name is Guangzhi Tang *(Pronunciation: g uu ung, j ee, t ah ng)*. I'm a PhD student in computer science at Rutgers University and member of the Computational Brain Lab (ComBra). My main research interests are neurorobotics and neuromorphic computing. More specifically, developing spiking neural networks (SNN) to solve various robotic problems with robustness, efficiency, and adaptivity.

We think the most important task for neuromorphic computing is to build the bridge between *robotics* and *brain science*. Robotics can provide real world interactions and intelligent applications as testbed for brain modeling, and brain theory can inspire robust and efficient solutions for robotic problems. By using SNN, we believe questions of both areas can be answered simultaneously.

(What did I accomplished) Currently we are developing SNNs for active exploration in unknown environments.
